# FMCS HELP FAQ

> [!NOTE]
> This is an official help page but if you want proper help from our support staff please go to our Discord support server \([FreeMcServer.net](https://discordapp.com/invite/u99dDtE)\).

## Why do I get an adblocker message when I don't have an adblocker or I turned off adblocker?

You might not have an adblocker (or you do, double check), but something is stoping ads from coming onto the page (it may not be a blocker at all). It might be your browser or it can be DNS (Domain Name System) or ISP (Internet Service Provider) level.

> [!NOTE]
> If this did not help you, please read \([this](https://help.getadblock.com/support/solutions/articles/6000161397-a-site-still-asks-me-to-turn-off-adblock-although-it-s-whitelisted-or-adblock-is-paused)\).

## Is the server free forever?

Yes, You are able to get the server for free.

## What are the server types?

1.13 and above performance issue warning:

> [!WARNING]
> 1.13 and above are really bad in performance and take a huge amount of ram. So when creating a server or moving to 1.13 and above please change the server type to high memory and reduce the view-distance to 3 in the server.properties file. Not doing so will cause a lot of performance issues and mostly crash the server on start.

### Always Online:

* Renew every 2 days
* 256 MB of RAM

### High Memory:

* Renew every 4 hours
* 1 GB of RAM

Both servers have an unlimited amount of slots and plugins.

> [!WARNING]
> Servers that are not renewed within 20 days are deleted.

## I cannot create a server?

Servers are taken most of the time as it is a mostly free service, so the only help I can give is to tell you to wait, as servers that have been expired for a long time are automatically deleted, every five mins. Please check back later for a space.

## My server says its offline and I am unable to connect?

If the server is offline there is no way of connecting, please check the console for any errors as to why it is offline and provide the staff in the discord the error when talking to them. Link is provided in the warning at the top of this page.

## I just got my server suspended what can I do?

In recent changes to the use of cracked plugins, server that are suspended for cracked plugins will be deleted. If the server is suspended again, the account will be terminated. You'll have to open a ticket asking for the server to be deleted. \(We can know if your server has been suspended before\).

If the server is suspended over something else, please open a ticket by going into your control panel and looking under support where it says tickets where it will redirect you to the page and click open ticket to create a ticket. Want to get help in creating a ticket? Follow the guide [here](en/#how-to-open-a-ticket).

> [!WARNING]
> Do not say or hint that you have opened a ticket in our discord support server, otherwise your ticket will be closed under our discord server rules.

## Are plugins like Orebfuscator, Votifier and DynMap allowed?

Yes, those plugin are allowed and previously they were not but they have lifted some restrictions on them.

Orebfuscator is no longer forbidden but will use up a lot of CPU, so it will most likely to cause your server to be stopped, just not suspended.

Votifier and DynMap are now allowed to be listening on a specific network port, if configured on the 50000 - 51000 port range.

DynMap will likely cause your server to be stopped due to high CPU usage. A guide on setting up DynMap on your server is [here](en/java-plugin-faq#how-to-setup-the-dynamic-map-plugin).

> [!WARNING]
> Use of Votifier and DynMap plugins outside of the 50000 - 51000 port range will lead to a direct and permanent account termination.

> [!NOTE]
> Any kind of remote console, bots (including, but not limited to Discord bots), RCON are still forbidden and will lead to account suspension or termination.

## How to be verified and do I need to complete everything on the verification list?

The way to get verified is to go to your control panel and on the side is Account Verification click it and fill everything in.

Yes, you need to fill everything. But I don't have a phone number for telegram or telegram is blocked in my country what can I do? If you are unable to verify, freemcserver cannot do anything about it. Unable to verify = Your not going to be verified. It's as simple as that.

**DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING:**

- Ask to be verified immediately

- Ask freemcserver.net staff why your request got denied or accepted

## My time keeps messing up and shows the wrong time?

Yes, the staff at the freemcserver.net discord know this as a just a UI bug. Nothing to worry about as your not getting scammed or anything. The server still follows the plan you have, its just the countdown is broken.

## How to get and use the recommended FTP client?

1. Download Filezilla Client [here](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)
2. Go to the FTP access on the left side of the control panel
3. Follow the perfect guide [here](https://forum.freemcserver.net/index.php?threads/connect-via-filezilla.6/)

> [!NOTE]
> While WebFTP is available, it is not recommended as it is not developed by freemcserver.net staff and may have some bugs and is quite unstable.

## How can I upload a world?

To upload a world, drag the world folder from where it is located on your local files area to the server files area you see when using Filezilla. A guide on how to get and use it is [here](en/#how-to-get-and-use-the-recommended-ftp-client.md). The last step is to choose the world to be used by renaming the world textbox under Service Information on the home page of the control panel to the world folder uploaded and then restart the server. A video on how to upload your world to your server is [here](https://youtu.be/OxsWxDtcXkg).

## How can I upload a plugin?

## What do I get from an upgrade?

By upgrading the server, you can get what is said that you will get. So does the 1gb add on to my current 1gb? No, it does not work like that. Let me explain below using the starter upgrade as an example.

### Starter Upgrade:

**RAM Memory:** 1024 MB \(1 GB\)

**CPU Limit:** Medium

**Max Slots:** Not limited

**Max Plugins:** Not limited

**Days between renewals:** 30 days

**Plan duration:** 30 days \(can be extended later\)

**Price:** 350 credits

The starter upgrade gives 1gb not added on to your existing amount, medium CPU limit, max slots and plugins are not limited so basically both are unlimited, a 30 day plan so not forever and has to be renewed every month and the price is just 350 credits which can be purchased or redeemed using codes from [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/freemcservernet/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/freemcservernet/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/freemcservernet), [Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/u99dDtE) or [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw48-B-1frsEx96wNgDEPwA).

## How can I delete my server or my account?

> [!WARNING]
> Please take the time to think about it before carrying on.
> 
> Once a server is deleted there will be no going back and freemcserver.net does not keep backups of anything so it will be permanently deleted.
> 
> Once an account is deleted, the account will be blacklisted and will not let you use the service again in the future.

If you still want to delete your server, create a ticket asking for your server to be deleted. A guide in opening a ticket is [here](en/#how-to-open-a-ticket).

If you still want to delete your account please send an email to [**gpdr@freemcserver.net**](mailto:gpdr@freemcserver.net) from the **email assigned to your account** asking for it to be deleted.
