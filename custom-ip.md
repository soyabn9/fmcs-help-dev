### Adding a Custom IP to your Minecraft server:

**DISCLAIMER 1:** This tutorial doesn't work on Bedrock/Windows 10/Pocket Edition servers! They don't support SRV records. 

**DISCLAIMER 2:** If you already own domain on Freenom or any other registrar, you can skip some of the domain registration steps and when you get to changing Nameservers of the domain, if you are unsure how you do it on your domain registrar, Google can help you!

**DISCLAIMER 3:** IP won't change on the panel! You can use both old and the new IP you created with help of this tutorial to connect to your server.

**DISCLAIMER 4:** If you are doing this tutorial from a mobile phone or tablet, on the Cloudflare page after step number **14)**, make sure to click on the context menu of your browser (usually `...` three vertical dots) and check the `Request Desktop Site` option. If by any chance you don't have such option, use a computer or you can't complete all the steps successfully.
